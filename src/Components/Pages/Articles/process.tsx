          Introduction

        <Text fontSize="l">
          In this article I will talk a bit about IoT network devices and their
          security and why you should consider the possibilities of attackers when
          you add IoT network devices to your own personal network.

          Only my PC and Phone matter, right?

          The short answer is no. People often don’t think about the security of
          other devices in their network because they are only aware that their
          most fundamental devices should be secure like their PC and Phone. In
          reality this is far from the truth due to the fact that other devices in
          your network also can be used to gain access to your inside network,
          this can result in a lot of problems. Even developers often don’t think
          about the security implications of their network devices which results
          in that a lot of these devices aren’t as secure as you probably think.
          The attacker can use the leverage of being inside your network without
          you knowing about it, which makes attacking someone a lot easier since
          they have a starting point that they can use to gather data or look for
          more possibilities to attack you.

          What are the risks of not securing my other network devices?
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Since we have IoT devices nowadays there is a lot of data that is
          collected from us that we may not be so aware of. This data can be used
          in a lot of ways that we may not even realize. This can be a
          functionality that maybe shows which devices are currently connected to
          your wireless network and since a lot of people don’t turn their devices
          off at home someone could monitor who is or is not at home for example.
          But another scary thing is that most home networks don’t detect if a
          device is compromised. This can make it so that an attacker sees that an
          IoT device on your network is vulnerable and attacks. This can result in
          the attacker infiltrating your network and now being able to extract
          data from this device or other devices inside your network or even
          attack other devices in your network that the attacker previously didn’t
          have access to.

          Should I be concerned?
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Well … I would say yes and no. The reason for this is it is not your job
          to make these devices secure and even if you wanted to do that it would
          require quite some resources and knowledge you don’t have at your
          disposal so making these devices secure isn’t something a user can do.
          But what you can do is try to make it as hard as possible for attackers
          to access your other devices on the network and implement monitoring and
          prevention tactics on your network so it becomes harder to make yourself
          a target.

          What can I do about it?
        </Text>
        <Text>
          The first thing I would suggest is segmenting your network so these IoT
          devices cannot access your personal devices like your computer and phone
          on the network. This would make it much harder if not even impossible to
          attack these devices due to the fact that they cannot communicate on
          their own with these other devices. Another thing you can do is
          implement monitoring and IPS systems. These systems monitor the traffic
          that takes place on your network and can notify you of strange network
          traffic from these devices so you can at least try to detect if
          something strange or unusual happens within your network so you can
          attempt to take action.

          Conclusion
        </Text>
        <Text>
          IoT devices are not as secure as people often think or realize. It’s
          important that you are aware of the situation so you can make consensus
          decisions in using these kinds of technologies and think about whether
          you want to use them and, if so, what you can do about these possible
          threats. I also think it's important that more architects and developers
          think about these possible implications so that over time these devices
          become more secure and people can use IoT devices without having to
          worry as much about these problems.{" "}
