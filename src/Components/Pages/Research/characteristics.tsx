      <b>What is IoT?</b>
      </Text>
      
      <Text fontSize={"l"}>
      IoT, or the Internet of Things, is a system of interrelated IoT computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals, or people with assigned UIDs. A thing on the internet of things can be any natural or artificial object that can be given an IP address and is able to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. For example, things, or the correct term 'IoT devices,' could be items like heart monitors, tesla cars, and animal biochips, to name a few.

      <Text fontSize={"l"}>The technology ecosystem of an IoT system is composed of the following four layers:</Text>
      <br></br>
      <UnorderedList>
        <ListItem>Device layer - This layer comprises the combination of sensors, actuators, hardware, software, connectivity, and gateways that constitute a device that connects and interacts with a network.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Data layer - This layer constitutes the collected, processed, sent, stored, analyzed, presented, and used in business contexts data.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Business layer - This layer comprises the business operations of IoT technology, such as billing and data marketplace administration.</ListItem>

      <b>How does it work?</b>
      </Text>
      <Text fontSize="l"> 
        The IoT ecosystem consists of web-enabled smart devices that use embedded systems, such as processors, sensors, and communication hardware, to collect, send and act on data gathered from their environments. On the other hand, IoT devices share sensor data they collect by connecting to an IoT gateway or another edge device where data is either sent to the cloud to be analyzed or analyzed locally. Sometimes, these devices communicate with other related devices and act on the information they get from one another. The devices do most of the work without human intervention, although people can interact with the devices. The connectivity, networking, and communication protocols used with these web-enabled devices depend on the specific IoT applications deployed.

      <br></br>
      <Text fontSize="l"> 
        IoT can also use AI and machine learning to help make data-collecting processes more dynamic and easier. 
      </Text>
      <br></br>
      <Text fontSize="l"> 
        A significant aspect of IoT systems is determining the devices' IoT protocols. In other words, how the devices connect and communicate. In the IoT technology stack, devices connect through gateways or built-in functionality. Gateways are part of IoT technology and have their use in helping link IoT devices to the cloud. Though not all IoT devices require a gateway, they are used to establish device-to-device communication or connect devices that are not IP based and cannot connect to the cloud directly. IoT devices collected data moves through a gateway, gets preprocessed at the edge, and then gets sent to the cloud. Using IoT gateways can lower latency and reduce transmission sizes. Additionally, having gateways as part of a system's IoT protocols also allows one to connect devices without direct internet access and provides an additional layer of security by protecting data moving in both directions.

      <br></br>
      <Text fontSize="l"> 
        The type of connectivity utilized as a part of IoT protocols depends on the device, its function, and its users. Typically, the distance the data must travel determines the type of IoT connectivity it needs. There are two types of IoT networks.
        Low-power, short-range networks are well-suited for homes, offices, and other small environments. They tend only to need small batteries and are usually inexpensive to operate. Some common examples of such networks are:
      </Text>
      <br></br>
      <UnorderedList>
        <ListItem>Bluetooth is adequate for high-speed data transfer. It sends both voice and data signals up to ten meters.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>NFC is a set of communication protocols for transmission between two electronic devices over 4 cm (1 ‚ÅÑ2 in) or less. NFC offers a low-speed connection with a simple setup that can be used to bootstrap more capable wireless connections.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Wi-Fi/802.11 - The low cost of operating Wi-Fi makes it a standard across homes and offices. However, it may not be the right choice for all scenarios because of its limited range and 24/7 energy consumption.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Z-Wave is a mesh network using low-energy radio waves to communicate from appliance to appliance.</ListItem>

      <b>IoT privacy</b>
      </Text>
      <Text fontSize={"l"}>
        Privacy is one of the key issues raised by IoT. The Internet of Things is becoming more widespread every day, meaning consumers need more and better security, which translates into privacy. 
      </Text>
      <br></br>
      <Text fontSize={"l"}>
        IoT privacy refers to the special considerations required to protect the information of individuals from exposure in the IoT environment in which almost any object or entity (physical or logical) can have a unique identifier and the ability to communicate autonomously over the internet or a similar network.
      </Text>
      <br></br>
      <Text fontSize={"l"}>
        As endpoints in the IoT environment transmit data autonomously, they also work in conjunction with other endpoints and communicate with them. Interoperability of things is essential to the IoT's functioning so that, for example, networked elements of a home, work together smoothly. 
      </Text>
      <br></br>
      <Text fontSize={"l"}>
        On its own, data transmitted by a given endpoint might not cause any privacy issues. However, even when fragmented data from multiple endpoints is gathered, collated, and analyzed, it can yield sensitive information. 
      </Text>
      <br></br>
      <Text fontSize={"l"}>
        The idea of networking appliances and other objects is new, especially in terms of global connectivity and autonomous data transfer, which are central to the Internet of Things. As such, there is not a lot of consideration for security in product design, which can make even everyday household objects points of vulnerability.

      <b>IoT protocols</b>
      </Text>
      <Text fontSize={"l"}>
        IoT devices communicate using IoT protocols. A protocol is a set of rules that dictates how data gets sent to the internet. IoT protocols ensure that information from one device or sensor gets read and understood by another device, a gateway, or a service. Different IoT protocols have been designed and optimized for different scenarios and usage. The type of IoT protocol needed depends on the system architecture layer in which the data will travel. Each IoT protocol in the IoT system architecture enables device-to-device, device-to-gateway, gateway-to-data center, or gateway-to-cloud communication, as well as communication between data centers.
